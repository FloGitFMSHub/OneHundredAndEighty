# OneHundredAndEightyCore
* Applies to automatic throw detection with [[DartboardRecognition]](https://github.com/YellowFive5/DartboardRecognition) 
  - Please keep in mind, that all of this stuff is under heavy development now. Problems of performance and optimization stays not on first place for me now. So I can't guarantee perfect work of this stuff on your "piece of sh*t" notebook. On my system (4.2 Ghz, 6 cores, 16RAM) all works correctly (with near 100% load ;-P )
